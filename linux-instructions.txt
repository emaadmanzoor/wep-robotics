USB:

Ensure udev rules work:
  /etc/udev/rules.d/70-lego.rules

SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0694", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0002", GROUP="lego", MODE="0664"

aur/lego-udev-rules

Also, user must be present int the GROUP group
  sudo usermod -aG lego pingu

  to verify udev
    udevadm monitor --kernel --property --udev
      See which /dev/* point the device appears on

  sudo packer -S
  If this doesn't work then you'll  get a segfault on COM_OpenNXT()
  in MATLAB, at the callib('libusb', 'usb_get_busses') line

  Also make sure you have libusb-0.1 (libusb-compat) installed,
  the include is in /usr/include/usb.h

Bluetooth:

  Start the connection via btconnect
    sudo ./btconnect 00:16:53:18:80:b5
  Change permissions of the rfcomm device
    sudo chmod 777 /dev/rfcomm0
  Or add yourself to the dialout/
  Run MATLAB

  after you're done, btconnect does not release the rfcomm device
  you'll need to do this yourself
    sudo rfcomm release /dev/rfcomm*
